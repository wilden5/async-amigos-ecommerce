1. **[Webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)**: A powerful bundler used to package and optimize the application's assets.
2. **[TypeScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)**: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code reliability and maintainability.
3. **[HTML Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin)**: Simplifies HTML file creation and injection of bundled scripts into the HTML template.
4. **[Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass)**: A popular CSS preprocessor that provides advanced features and improves CSS code organization.
5. **[PostCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss)**: A versatile CSS tool that enhances and transforms styles using plugins.
6. **[Stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint)**: A linter for style sheets that helps maintain consistent and error-free CSS code.
7. **[Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)**: An opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
8. **[ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)**: A JavaScript linter that identifies and enforces coding patterns and best practices.
9. **[Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)**: A testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.
10. **[Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky)**: A Git hook manager used to trigger scripts on pre-commit and pre-push actions.
11. **[lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged)**: A tool that runs linters on staged files to enforce code quality before committing.
12. **[Terser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terser)**: A JavaScript minifier that compresses and optimizes the final build output.
13. **[Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)**: Automatically adds browser-specific prefixes to CSS properties to enhance compatibility.
14. **[Mini CSS Extract Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-css-extract-plugin)**: Extracts CSS into separate files for better performance.
15. **[Webpack Dev Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)**: A development server that enables live reloading and better development experience.
16. **[ts-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-jest)**: A TypeScript preprocessor for Jest to enable testing TypeScript files.
17. **[@typescript-eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin)**: Integrates ESLint with TypeScript for enhanced linting capabilities.
